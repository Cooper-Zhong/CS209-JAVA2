/**
 * Whenever we spawn a new thread, that thread attains the new state. When the method start() is invoked
 * on a thread, the thread scheduler moves that thread to the runnable state. Whenever the join() method
 * is invoked on any thread instance, the current thread executing that statement has to wait for this
 * thread to finish its execution, i.e., move that thread to the terminated state. Therefore, before the
 * final print statement is printed on the console, the program invokes the method join() on thread t2,
 * making the thread t1 wait while the thread t2 finishes its execution and thus, the thread t2 get to
 * the terminated or dead state. Thread t1 goes to the waiting state because it is waiting for thread t2
 * to finish it's execution as it has invoked the method join() on thread t2.
